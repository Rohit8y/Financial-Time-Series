The M3 time series competition, organized by the [International Institute of Forecasters (IIF)](https://forecasters.org/resources/time-series-data/m3-competition/), stands as one of the most influential and comprehensive forecasting competitions in the field of time series analysis. The competition was designed to address the limitations and challenges faced by forecasters in accurately predicting various types of time series data, including economic indicators, financial market trends, demographic patterns, and industrial demand, among others.

In this work, we focus on the financial aspect of the M3 competition given its complexity and limited data availability.
